**quince** is a drum machine toy inspired by http://emberbeats.gavinjoyce.com.

[The demo for **quince** lives on Netlify.](https://mystifying-lamport-66aca0.netlify.app/)

**Learning Objectives:**

~~Among my learning objectives for **quince** was to get a handle on React's `useReducer` hook, which makes more sense than Redux for a project this small (and which, rather happily, feels like writing Elm :D).~~

I have decided to use Redux with this project after all; the code was unweildy, at least to read.

**Todo:**

* Custom hook for playback [x]
* Per-channel mute button
* More presets!
* More drumkits!
* Code organization [x]
* Clearer, friendlier UI
* More attractive styling (including icons)
* More responsive layout
* Super duper stretch goal: drumkit builder
